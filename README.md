# uni-happy-ranking

**[Website is here](https://uni-happy-ranking.herokuapp.com/)**

This web app is the front-end for sentiment analysis of Tweets made by students about their university. The goal is to rank universities by happiness from social media. 

The data element of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/basharovV/UniHappyRanking/).

It's a poor first attempt, but I aim to improve the data over time, and I welcome suggestions and feedback :)
